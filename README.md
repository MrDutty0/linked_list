## linked_list

During this project, I tackled the implementation of a LinkedList class along with a Node class in Ruby. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

1. **Implemented LinkedList Class:** I created a LinkedList class to manage the linked list data structure. This class includes various methods for manipulating the list, such as appending, prepending, accessing nodes by index, and more.

2. **Created Node Class:** I also defined a Node class, which represents individual elements within the linked list. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

3. **Implemented Core Methods:** I implemented essential methods in the LinkedList class, including:
   - `#append(value)`
   - `#prepend(value)`
   - `#size`
   - `#head`
   - `#tail`
   - `#at(index)`
   - `#pop`
   - `#contains?(value)`
   - `#find(value)`
   - `#to_s`

4. **Handled Extra Credit Tasks:** Additionally, I tackled extra credit tasks by implementing the following methods:
   - `#insert_at(value, index)`
   - `#remove_at(index)`

Throughout the project, I ensured that the code was clean, well-commented, and followed best practices to maintain readability and conciseness.
